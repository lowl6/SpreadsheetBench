Specifically, I want to avoid returning values where there is an unrelated comment in the lookup range (e.g., skipping comments in Column B of Sheet1) and instead ensure that the function only returns the value where the type is 'machine'. For example, I have an issue where the XLOOKUP is incorrectly returning 0 for an item code M023 instead of the correct score 450 due to an irrelevant comment being fetched.   My current formula is: XLOOKUP(\"*\"&A1&\"*\",Sheet1!A:A,Sheet1!D:D,\"\",2)",
