However, I need to distinguish between 'Table' and other words like 'adjustable' or 'paintable' that also contain the word 'table' but should not trigger the same output. If none of the specified words are present, the default output should be 'Home & Garden > Lighting > Lighting Fixtures > Ceiling Light Fixtures'. I have provided an example file for reference.",

For example, if the values in column C for Arugula, Beetroot, and Carrot are 4.0, 5.0, and 5.0 respectively, the sum should be 14.0.
