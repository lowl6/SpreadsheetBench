The sum should only include the values from the rows where the cells in column C are not empty. For example, if the values in column C for Arugula, Beetroot, and Carrot are 4.0, 5.0, and 5.0 respectively, the sum should be 14.0. However, I am encountering issues perhaps due to empty cells in column C, and neither VLOOKUP nor XLOOKUP seem to work. I'm using WPS Office.",
