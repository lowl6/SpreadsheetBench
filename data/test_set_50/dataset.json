However, there's an issue with the date format changing from dd/mm/yyyy in the original data to mm/dd/yy after the extraction, which needs correction. Additionally, when there are multiple entries for the same last date, such as with a brand 'camera,' I require the values to be summed up. For example, if 'camera' appears twice on the last date with a value of 20 each, the result should display a single entry with the sum of 40 for that date and brand. The result should also show the modifications for duplicated last dates.",
