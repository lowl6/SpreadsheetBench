Employees accrue 48 hours per year until they complete three years of service, 56 hours per year until the fourth year, 88 hours each year for service between four to seven years, 128 hours annually for service between seven to fifteen years, 168 hours each year for fifteen to twenty-five years of service, and 208 hours annually after twenty-five years of service. While PTO can be used after 90 days, it accrues from the start date and carries over to the next year, keeping a maximum of 80 hours before completing three years. The extra 8 hours in each time frame account for a floating holiday, simplifying the calculation. If no PTO is taken, for example, an employee would have a total of 48+48+56 hours by the end of the third year, but only 80 hours would carry over, starting the fourth year with 80+56 hours. This pattern continues with the respective accumulation per year. The issue is how to represent these conditions and calculations correctly in Excel, considering that people will use PTO through the year, and anything over 80 hours is lost unless used.",
